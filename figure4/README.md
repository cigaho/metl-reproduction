# Methods to reproduce figure4

Figure 4 is a 2-D heatmap that shows how METL’s predictive performance on the GB1 fitness landscape depends jointly on the amount of experimental and simulated data used to train the target model. The x-axis (on a log scale) is the simulated dataset size in thousands of Rosetta-generated GB1 variants (1k up to 8192k), and the y-axis lists experimental dataset sizes (10, 20, 40, …, 20 480 measured variants), with each row corresponding to one of those experimental sizes. Each cell of the 12×14 grid is colored by the Spearman correlation between METL’s predictions and held-out experimental measurements for that particular (experimental, simulated) combination, and also has the numeric ρ value written inside. The figure shows that when you only have a small number of experimental measurements (bottom rows), adding more simulated data (moving right) substantially improves performance, whereas once you have thousands of experimental data points (upper rows), the correlation is already around 0.9–0.97 and further increases in simulated data give only minor gains, forming a bright yellow plateau at the top of the heatmap.

Recomputing the full 12×14 METL performance grid of Fig. 4 would require training 168 separate target models over millions of GB1 variants, which is computationally infeasible on a our few and weak workstations. Instead, we inspected the provided GB1 Rosetta database, extracted a 1M-variant subset for future experiments, and reproduced Fig. 4 by plotting the Spearman correlation grid reported by the authors (read off from the published figure) with the same experimental and simulated dataset size axes

Note, this is different to the ones shown on ppt, but the same method was used, you can run this code and it will produce this image, our previous version code is not good enough, so it is updated
